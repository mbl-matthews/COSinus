# COSinus

COSinus stands for "Club Organization Software" and is a software meant to simplify the organization of accounting of small clubs.

The Software comes from a specific problem of myself where i need a simple way to keep track of accounting in our small club consisting of 15 people.

## Idea

I wanted to manage the little register in which our club keeps its many better than with a piece of paper. The analog version was a simple list with each entry consisting of an added or taken amount of money - some kind of movement - a message to that movement as well as the new amount and the date.
